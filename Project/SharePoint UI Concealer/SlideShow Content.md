### **Slide 1: Introduction to SharePoint Framework (SPFx)**  
- **What is SPFx?**  
  - A modern web development framework for building client-side customizations in SharePoint.
  - Built on open web standards like TypeScript, React, and Node.js.  
  - Supports both SharePoint Online and SharePoint on-premises (2016 and later).  

- **Why SPFx?**  
  - Enables seamless customization of SharePoint UI and functionality.  
  - Fully responsive and mobile-ready.  
  - Compatible with both modern and classic SharePoint experiences.

---

### **Slide 2: Project Purpose**  
- **Objective**:  
  - To customize SharePoint UI by selectively hiding or blocking access based on user roles and site conditions.  

- **Primary Goals**:  
  - Hide SharePoint UI for non-admin users or all users.  
  - Block access to specific pages or the entire site.  
  - Display a styled "Access Denied" message when access is restricted.

---

### **Slide 3: Key Features**  
- **Admin Detection**:  
  - Uses SharePoint Permissions API to identify admin users.

- **Conditional Rendering**:
  - Config-driven logic to determine when to hide UI or block access.

- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**:  
  - Hides specific UI elements dynamically based on conditions.

- **Custom Fallback UI**:  
  - Injects custom HTML and CSS to display an "Access Denied" message.

- **Support for Multiple Scenarios**:  
  - Blocks specific paths, entire sites, or selected user groups via a configuration file.

---

### **Slide 4: Use Cases**  
- **Corporate Intranets**:  
  - Restrict access to sensitive areas of a SharePoint site.  

- **Role-Based Access Control**:  
  - Display custom UI for different user roles, such as admins versus regular users.  

- **Ensure Compliance**:  
  - Prevent unauthorized users from accessing confidential information.  

- **Enhanced User Experience**:  
  - Provide a clear and professional "Access Denied" screen instead of generic errors.

### **Slide 5: Architecture & Components**  
- **Project Structure**:  
  ```
  src/
  └── extensions/
      └── uiConcealer/
          ├── UiConcealerApplicationCustomizer.ts     <-- Main logic
          ├── config.ts                               <-- Configuration file
          └── helper.ts                               <-- Helper functions and constants
  ```

- **Core Components**:
  1. **UiConcealerApplicationCustomizer.ts**:
     - Contains the main logic for UI hiding and access restriction.  
  2. **Config.ts**:
     - Manages configuration flags for conditional rendering.  
  3. **Helper.ts**:
     - Provides reusable functions and constants, including custom HTML templates.  

- **Key Methods**:
  - `isAdminUser()`: Detects admin users using SharePoint REST API.  
  - `_hideWebPageLikeMS()`: Dynamically hides SharePoint UI elements.

### **Slide 6: Live Demo / Screenshots**  
- **Screenshots**:
  - "Access Denied" page with a custom message and fallback styles.  
  - Before and after UI hiding for non-admin users.  
  - Configuration file setup and deployment steps.  

- **Live Demo**:
  - Showcase the extension in action using the SharePoint Workbench or a real SharePoint site.

---

### **Slide 7: Benefits**  
- **For Developers**:  
  - Easy to implement and deploy using SPFx tools like Yeoman and Gulp.  
  - Fully configurable via a centralized config file.  
  - Seamless integration with SharePoint's existing architecture.  

- **For Organizations**:  
  - Enhanced control over site access and UI customization.  
  - Improved user experience with professional error messages.  
  - Supports compliance and security requirements.

---

### **Slide 8: Challenges & Considerations**  
- **Performance Impacts**:  
  - DOM manipulation for UI hiding may affect performance on large pages.  

- **Versioning**:  
  - Updates to the `.sppkg` file may require manual versioning to avoid caching issues.  

- **Deployment Complexity**:  
  - Requires careful deployment to SharePoint App Catalog and tenant sites.  

- **Testing Limitations**:  
  - Application Customizers cannot be tested in the local workbench and require the online workbench.

---

### **Slide 9: Future Enhancements**  
- **Dynamic Role Management**:  
  - Integrate with Azure AD to dynamically fetch user roles and permissions.  

- **Advanced Analytics**:  
  - Track user access attempts and generate reports for admins.  

- **Customizable UI**:  
  - Allow organizations to customize the "Access Denied" page with branding and messages.  

- **Performance Optimization**:  
  - Explore methods to reduce the impact of DOM manipulation on large SharePoint pages.

### **Slide 10: Q & A**  
- Invite questions from the audience.  
- Provide clarifications on implementation, use cases, or deployment.
