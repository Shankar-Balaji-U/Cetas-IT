## SPFX Interview Questions: React and JavaScript

As React is a popular choice for building SPFX web parts, interviewers often assess your understanding of React
concepts and JavaScript fundamentals. This section covers common questions related to these technologies.

### 16) What are the key concepts of React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It’s known for its component-based architecture,
efficient rendering, and declarative style. Some of the key concepts in React include:

- **Components:** UI elements are broken down into reusable components, making the code more modular and maintainable.
- **JSX:** A syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like structures within your JavaScript code, making UI definition more intuitive.
- **Virtual DOM:** React maintains a virtual representation of the actual DOM, allowing it to efficiently update only the necessary parts of the UI when data changes.
- **State and Props:** State represents data internal to a component, while props are read-only data passed down from a parent component.

### 17) Explain the component lifecycle in React

React components go through a series of lifecycle methods that allow you to control their behavior at various stages.
These methods include:

- **Mounting:** constructor(), render(), componentDidMount() – These methods are called when the component is created and added to the DOM.
- **Updating:** shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), componentDidUpdate() – These methods are involved when the component’s props or state change, leading to re-rendering.
- **Unmounting:** componentWillUnmount() – This method is called when the component is removed from the DOM.

Understanding the component lifecycle is crucial for managing side effects, optimizing performance, and handling data
updates.

### 18) How do you handle state management in React?

State management is a key aspect of React development, especially for complex applications. While React’s built-in
state management is sufficient for simpler cases, you might need more robust solutions for larger applications. Here
are some common approaches:

- **React’s built-in state:** Use this.state and this.setState() for managing component-level state.

- **Context API:** Share data between components without explicitly passing props down the component tree.
- **Redux:** A predictable state container that provides a centralized store for managing application state.
- **Zustand:** A small, fast, and scalable state management library that offers a simpler alternative to Redux.

The choice of state management solution depends on the complexity of your application and your team’s preferences.

### 19) What is the difference between props and state?

Props and state are both mechanisms for managing data in React components, but they serve different purposes:

- **Props:** Props (short for “properties”) are read-only data passed down from a parent component to a child component. They are used to configure and customize the child component’s behavior.
- **State:** State represents data that is internal to a component and can change over time. Changes to state trigger re-rendering of the component.

Understanding the distinction between props and state is essential for building well-structured and maintainable
React applications.

### 20) How do you handle errors and exceptions in React?

Error handling is crucial for preventing crashes and providing a better user experience. React offers error
boundaries, which are special components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree. Here’s
how they work:

- **Define an error boundary:** Create a class component that implements either componentDidCatch(error, info) or static getDerivedStateFromError(error).
- **Use the error boundary:** Wrap the components that might throw errors within the error boundary component.

Error boundaries allow you to gracefully handle errors, display fallback UI, and log error information for debugging.

### 21) What is JSX and how does it work?

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your
JavaScript files. It makes it easier to define UI structures in React. Here’s how it works:

- **Write HTML-like code:** Define your UI using familiar HTML tags and attributes within your JavaScript code.
- **Babel transformation:** A tool called Babel transforms the JSX code into regular JavaScript code that the browser can understand.
- **React rendering:** React uses the transformed JavaScript code to create and update the actual DOM.

JSX provides a more intuitive and readable way to define UI components in React.

### 22) Explain the concept of the virtual DOM

The virtual DOM is a key concept in React’s efficient rendering mechanism. It’s a lightweight, in-memory
representation of the actual DOM. Here’s how it works:

- **React creates a virtual DOM:** When a component renders, React creates a virtual DOM tree that mirrors the structure of the actual DOM.
- **React compares virtual DOMs:** When data changes, React creates a new virtual DOM tree and compares it to the previous one.
- **React updates the actual DOM:** React identifies the minimal set of changes needed and efficiently updates only those parts of the actual DOM, minimizing browser reflows and repaints.

The virtual DOM is a core reason behind React’s performance and ability to handle complex UI updates.

In addition to SPFX and front-end technologies, you should have a solid understanding of SharePoint.
