# Basics of Networking Topics

## 1. Networking Fundamentals
- **Definition of Networking**: What it is and its purpose.
- **Types of Networks**:
  - LAN (Local Area Network)
  - WAN (Wide Area Network)
  - MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
  - PAN (Personal Area Network)
  - CAN (Campus Area Network)
- **Network Topologies**:
  - Star, Bus, Ring, Mesh, Tree
- **Networking Devices**:
  - Routers, Switches, Hubs, Access Points, Modems, Bridges, Gateways.

## 2. OSI and TCP/IP Models
- **OSI Model Layers** (7 layers):
  - Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application
- **TCP/IP Model Layers** (4 layers):
  - Network Interface, Internet, Transport, Application
 -->

## 3. Protocols
- **Common Protocols**:
  - HTTP/HTTPS: Web browsing
  - FTP/SFTP: File transfer
  - SMTP/IMAP/POP3: Email communication
  - DNS: Domain name resolution
  - DHCP: Dynamic IP allocation
  - SNMP: Network management
  - ICMP: Error reporting
  - ARP: Address resolution

<!--
- **Transport Layer Protocols**:
  - TCP: Connection-oriented
  - UDP: Connectionless
 -->

## 4. IP Addressing
- **IP Address Types**:
  - IPv4: 32-bit addressing
  - IPv6: 128-bit addressing
- **Classes of IPv4 Addresses**:
  - Class A, B, C, D, E
- **Private vs Public IP Addresses**
- **Subnetting**:
  - Subnet masks and CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
- **Default Gateway**

## 5. DNS and DHCP
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**:
  - Resolves domain names to IP addresses
  - Record types: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**:
  - Assigns IP addresses dynamically

## 6. MAC Address and ARP
- **MAC Address**: Unique hardware address of a device.
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**:
  - Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.

## 7. Networking Security Basics
- **Firewalls**: Filtering traffic between networks.
- **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)**: Secure remote access.
- **Encryption Protocols**:
  - SSL/TLS: For secure web traffic.
  - IPsec: For encrypted IP traffic.
- **Access Control**: Authentication and authorization.

## 8. Wireless Networking
- **Wi-Fi Standards**:
  - IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax
- **SSID (Service Set Identifier)**
- **WPA/WPA2/WPA3**: Wireless security protocols.

## 9. Common Networking Tools
- **Ping**: Test connectivity.
- **Traceroute**: Trace the path packets take.
- **Netstat**: Show network connections.
- **Wireshark**: Network packet analyzer.
- **Nslookup**: Query DNS records.

## 10. Network Troubleshooting
- **Common Issues**:
  - IP conflicts
  - DNS resolution failures
  - Connectivity drops
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  - Checking physical connections.
  - Verifying IP configurations.
  - Using ping and traceroute.

## 11. Network Architectures
- **Client-Server Model**
- **Peer-to-Peer Model**
- **Cloud Networking Basics**

## 12. VLANs and VPNs
- **VLAN (Virtual LAN)**: Logical segmentation of a network.
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: Secured private network over public networks.

## 13. Network Performance Metrics
- **Bandwidth**: Maximum data transfer rate.
- **Latency**: Delay in data transmission.
- **Throughput**: Actual data transfer rate.
- **Jitter**: Variation in latency.

## 14. Integration
- One, Two, Three box integration
